  "description": "The Yelp reviews dataset consists of reviews from Yelp. It is extracted from the Yelp Dataset Challenge 2015 data.\nThe Yelp reviews full star dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the above dataset.\nIt is first used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun.\nCharacter-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification.
